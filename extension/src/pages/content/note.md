# Major Layout

## Current

- sidebar, has its own -local-slider-width
- when the slider is at toggle off status, the major content takes the fullwidth

## What I wanted

- if the side bar is open
- my content takes the same width as left sidebar
- if the sidebar is close, my content takes the sidebar width without moving the major content range
